###### Name in progress

### Free Kick.com chat bot build on NodeJS using the awesome NestJS library.
___

In this repo you'll also find a client library, KClient, to interact with the private Kick.com API using Playwright to get around the aggressive Cloudflare blocking.

The bot is in heavy development currently and still needs a lot of work. If you wanna try getting it running you'll need to have the `database` script running before starting the Nest application. Have fun :)
